“The designer made use of contrasting colors,
simple geometric design and minimalistic
applications to reinforce the clien’s corporate
identity as a leader in technology. An example
of this can be seen in the stainless steel beam
guiding people’s attention to the HITACHI world.”

The designer keeps the whole spatial integrity by combining down lights and hidden ‘light strips’ on the ceiling .Apart from the overall appearance, the lighting system can be controlled in different modes for video conference or projector presentation. The designer adds a piece of intelligent technology to make this meeting room more user-oriented.
